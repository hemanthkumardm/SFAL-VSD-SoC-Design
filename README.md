# SFAL-VSD-SoC-Design Program Progress

This repository documents my journey through the SFAL-VSD-SoC-Design program organized by NASSCOM. The program focuses on system-on-chip (SoC) design, providing hands-on experience and practical knowledge in various aspects of VLSI and SoC development.
## Repository Structure

	‚Ä¢	Day-wise Progress: Each folder contains a detailed breakdown of daily tasks, summaries of learning, tool installations, and code or design files.
	‚Ä¢	Tools and Setup: Step-by-step documentation of the tools required for the program, along with installation guides and configuration snapshots.

## Objectives

	‚Ä¢	Learn the fundamentals of SoC design.
	‚Ä¢	Gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and workflows.
	‚Ä¢	Document daily progress to track growth and improvements.
	‚Ä¢	Showcase projects and learning outcomes.
