# SFAL-VSD-SoC-Design Program Progress

This repository documents my journey through the SFAL-VSD-SoC-Design program organized by NASSCOM. The program focuses on system-on-chip (SoC) design, providing hands-on experience and practical knowledge in various aspects of VLSI and SoC development.

## Overview of the Digital VLSI System-on-Chip (SoC) design and planning process

1. **Chip Modeling**
   - Achieve equivalence between the original specification model (O0) and the C model (O1).

2. **RTL Architecture**
   - Ensure equivalence between the specification model (O1) and the Register Transfer Level (RTL) representation (O2).

3. **SoC Design Flow**
   - Divide the chip design into processors and peripherals/IPs.

4. **SoC Integration**
   - Confirm equivalence across all stages (O1 == O2 == O3).

5. **GDSII Creation**
   - Prepare graphical data structure stream information for interchange.
   - Ensure all models are equivalent (O1 == O2 == O3 == O4).


## Repository Structure

	•	Day-wise Progress: Each folder contains a detailed breakdown of daily tasks, summaries of learning, tool installations, and code or design files.
	•	Tools and Setup: Step-by-step documentation of the tools required for the program, along with installation guides and configuration snapshots.

## Objectives

	•	Learn the fundamentals of SoC design.
	•	Gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and workflows.
	•	Document daily progress to track growth and improvements.
	•	Showcase projects and learning outcomes.
