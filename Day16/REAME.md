<summary><strong>1. Design Library Cell using Magic Layout and ngspice Characterization</strong></summary>

This lab focuses on designing a library cell, such as a CMOS inverter, using Magic Layout editor. The key steps include:
- Creating a physical layout of the circuit.
- Extracting netlists from the layout.
- Characterizing the cell using **ngspice** simulations for delay, power, and performance metrics.

**Key Deliverables**:
- A functional library cell with verified design rules (DRC) and layout-versus-schematic (LVS) checks.
- Simulated performance metrics.
